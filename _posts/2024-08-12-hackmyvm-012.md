### The start of the challenge
I quickly realized that the only provided asset was an audio file. After listening to it, I recognized that the language was **French**. Since I donâ€™t speak French, I needed to **translate it into English**.


### transcribe the audio
I downloaded an AI model capable of converting the speech into text. 
I used the **whisper standalone for Windows**. the link for the repo [`whisper-standalone-win`](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win)
>faster-whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.


### Command:
```bat
faster-whisper-xxl.exe "012.mp3" -l fr -m medium -o source --sentence
```

A quick Google search and spell-check revealed the correct word, leading to the solution.
